# Collaboration & Forced Independence (AGI Pragma)

## Rationale
AGI Pragma explicitly separates collaborative performance
from individual reasoning capability.

High performance in a group does not imply understanding.
Forced isolation is required to validate true competence.

## Modes

### Collaborative Mode
Agents:
- can share beliefs, hypotheses, and partial solutions,
- observe actions and outcomes of other agents,
- coordinate strategies.

Purpose:
- accelerate exploration,
- expose agents to diverse hypotheses.

---

### Forced Independence Mode (FIP)
Agents:
- have no access to other agents' beliefs or actions,
- must infer world rules independently,
- bear full consequences of decisions.

Purpose:
- validate individual understanding,
- detect dependency and imitation,
- test robustness under isolation.

---

## Mode Switching
The environment may switch modes:
- periodically,
- randomly,
- or based on performance triggers.

Agents are not informed in advance.

## Evaluation Metrics
- Performance drop from collaborative → isolation mode
- Recovery speed after isolation
- Belief divergence vs convergence
- Independence score

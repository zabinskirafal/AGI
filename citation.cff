  AGI Pragma (v2.2.0) is a research framework for adaptive intelligence. 
  This version introduces the 'Decision Integrity Layer', integrating 
  FMEA-based risk assessment (RPN) with Critical Path Analysis (CPA). 
  It enables autonomous agents to govern their own reasoning through 
  cognitive circuit breakers and Bayesian belief updating in 
  high-entropy environments.
